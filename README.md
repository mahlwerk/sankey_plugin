This is an algorithm to create Sankey diagrams from QGIS attribute tables containing the data from historical maps, created in the context of the UrbanMetaMapping Project (https://urbanmetamapping.uni-bamberg.de/en/).

Currently there is a python script 'maps_to_sankey.py' in the sankey folder, that creates a simple sankey diagram (one source, one target) with a lot of hard coding.

The goal is to translate this to a QGIS plugin ('sankey_diagram_creator'-folder). 
This is my first time doing that, so I am happy about input.
